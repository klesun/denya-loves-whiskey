        1.3.1. Coffins
               When an enemy dies, he is instantly wrapped into a coffin. This 
               coffin can be standed on - use it to surpass some obstacles.
               All coffins are sent to the graveyard once you clear the sector to make you feel more gultyy.
               Coffins is a resource you use to open locations and clear the game 100%.
               The more coffins you get the more skillfull you become.
               You could treat it like XP.

               Like the coffins, they are a resource to open stuff. But berries do not 
               provide you with new fighting skills, instead they are used like money to buy 
               stuff to clear some (on later stages mandatory) trials
               You could treat it like money
