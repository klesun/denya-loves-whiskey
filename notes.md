1. Gameplay
    1.1. Jump on platforms; trigger doors; use special abilities to get from point A to point B
    1.2. Abilities
        1.2.1. Jump - jump
        1.2.2. Simple attack - simple attack
        1.2.3. Lunge - simple attack on a greeter distance that slows you afterwards
        1.2.4. Parry - i'll think about fighting system more later
        1.2.5. Sprint - can be used once N seconds to give you a boost in 
                direction of camera in the air - use this to surpass obstacles
    1.3. Collectable items
        1.3.1. Coffins
               When an enemy dies, he is instantly wrapped into a coffin. This 
               coffin can be standed on - use it to surpass some obstacles.
               All coffins are sent to the graveyard once you clear the sector to make you feel more gultyy.
               Coffins is a resource you use to open locations and clear the game 100%.
               The more coffins you get the more skillfull you become.
               You could treat it like XP.
        1.3.2. Berries
               Like the coffins, they are a resource to open stuff. But berries do not 
               provide you with new fighting skills, instead they are used like money to buy 
               stuff to clear some (on later stages mandatory) trials
               You could treat it like money
        1.3.3. Orb of Motivation
               Very rare stuff - usually is located on a secret spot or is given 
               as a reward for helping people. Used only to unlock locations and trials.

               I suggest having a quote for heroine per each Orb, like "I climbed 
               the Cilinder Mountain!" or "I overmatched the fencing hermitess!".
               These quotes will be randomly thrown in a response to npc-s that try to talk with you.

               Also i suggest at some point in game some villain to steal all your Orbs of Motivation 
               making you to respond just with a single "угу" to everyone till you beat the villain.

```
Меня зовут Калина, я девочка с рапирой
Мне 10 лет, и я лучшая фехтовальщица мира
Я конечно персонаж хороший и люблю людей,
Но тех, кто не верит в мой скил, пронзаю рапирой своей

Я живу без родителей, поэтому часто голодаю
Вкалываю за гроши, ем белочек и наказываю негодяев
Практикую медицину - прописываю уколы от долбоёбства
Ищу возможности разбогатеть просто

Мой отец научил меня мастерству протыкания
Когда я достигла потолка, он дал мне последнее задание:
"Проткни мне сердце так чтоб оно осталось целым тем не менее"
Я приняла испытание, но прокололась к сожалению

Гибель наставника многому меня научила
Эту абсолютную технику и своё хладнокровие я получила
Из моей крови теперь можно колоть лёд для вискаря
Но тех, кто не в курсе я стараюсь не тревожить своей унылостью зря

Я наколола серьёзность у себя на груди
И с натянутой улыбкой отправилась по своему жизненому пути...
